# Summer2021-TI-RSLK-Max
Obstacle avoiding and navigation robot
This project consists of a TI-RSLK Max kit which is used to create a simple obstacle avoiding and path navigating robot. The robot sets out on a straight path to its destination which is a given length away from the starting point. If it does not encounter any obstacle, the robot simply goes to the destination and stops there. However, if the robot encounters any obstacle on the path, it will perform a manuever to change its location away from the obstacle and recalculates the new path and gets to its final destination.
